# Changelog

## 3.0.0 (2022-05-18)
- major changes for 3.x

## 2.2.8 (2021-03-15)
- also push `0.0.0.0/0` when `defaultGateway` is `true` to work around bug in 
  Windows online detection

## 2.2.7 (2021-02-23)
- `tlsProtection` is no longer an option, it is always `tls-crypt`

## 2.2.6 (2020-11-27)
- update for `ProfileConfig` refactor
- fix IP range check
- fix a bug where `max-clients` was one higher than available IPs in the 
  OpenVPN client IP pool
- also specify `keepalive` in TCP server config to work around obscure UDP/TCP
  failover client connection bug
  
## 2.2.5 (2020-10-20)
- perform some checks on the profile configuration before writing the OpenVPN
  server configuration:
    - make sure `profileNumber` is not reused;
    - make sure the `listen` and `vpnProtoPorts` combinations do not overlap 
      between profiles
    - make sure there is no overlap in IP ranges (`range` / `range6` option) 
      assigned to VPN profiles (for now shows warning if there is a problem)
    - make sure `range` is `/29` or lower per OpenVPN process 
      (OpenVPN limitation)
    - make sure `range6` is `/112` or lower per OpenVPN process 
      (OpenVPN limitation)
- implement changes for updated `Config` API
- add support for pushing `DOMAIN-SEARCH` to VPN clients next to `DOMAIN`
- update for common HTTP client

## 2.2.4 (2020-09-08)
- add `ECDSA` certificate support for TLSv1.2, already supported on TLSv1.3

## 2.2.3 (2020-08-31)
- do not sort OpenVPN server configuration file to avoid having `DOMAIN` 
  ordering also changed in `dhcp-option`.
- no longer need to provide the `hostName` in the API call to generate a 
  certificate, vpn-server-api takes care of that
- no need to autoload anything in `bin/generate-firewall.php`

## 2.2.2 (2020-07-01)
- support adding `--up` to the server configuration file when 
  `/etc/openvpn/up` exists and is executable

## 2.2.1 (2020-05-12)
- remove `certificate-info` script as it no longer worked

## 2.2.0 (2020-04-15)
- the `vpn-server-node-generate-firewall` script is a dummy now. Current 
  firewall is kept, but in order to modify firewalls you have to do this 
  manually now or use your own tools. See 
  [documentation](https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/v2/FIREWALL.md#updating).

## 2.1.4 (2020-04-05)

- allow admin to disable installing/generating firewall rules when running
  `vpn-server-node-generate-firewall --install` for systems without firewall
  or custom firewall

## 2.1.3 (2020-04-01)
- fix removal of "default gateway" push when also having routes configured

## 2.1.2 (2020-04-01)

- even when `defaultGateway` is `true` push the routes as configured in `route`
  (issue #44)

  in a separate directory

- no longer specify `auth none` in server configuration

## 2.0.4 (2019-10-14)

  server through the client's normal gateway to avoid problems when pushing 
  routes that contain the VPN server's public IP address

- remove tls-auth support
- remove "multi instance" support
- update firewalling

## 1.1.2 (2018-11-09)

  `tls-crypt`

## 1.0.22 (2018-10-10)
- when DNS servers are set, but VPN is not used as default gateway _do_ send 
  the DNS addresses
